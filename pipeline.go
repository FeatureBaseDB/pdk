// NamedReadCloser adds the ability to associate a name and other

// e.g. a directory reading source to associate the file name of each
// reader it returns. This might be needed to generate the identifier
// for each record within the file, or to help build a recovery
// mechanism in the case of process crash (tracking which files have
// and have not been read yet).

// for S3 might return each object in an S3 bucket as a reader. Each
// object might be a CSV file with many individual records which a
